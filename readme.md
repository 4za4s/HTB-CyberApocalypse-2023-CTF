<h1> HTB CTF - My Contribution</h1>
I managed to get 18 flags
They took many hours of reasearch and learning
but I learned a lot in the 5 days it was running

<h3> Hardware </h3>
  - completed all hardware challenges<br>
  - These were pretty fun and not to difficult<br>
  - Favourite had to be the last flag where i had to using Hamming (7,4)
    to fix errors in an incoming signal, that was super cool to me as I didn't 
    even consider that it was possible before I researched it
 
<h3> Machine Learning </h3>
  - completed all except the last one<br>
  - I had a working algorithm but ran out of time before it was fully trained<br>
  - Was super hard and took a lot of research as I knew little about actually implementing
    NN and using them going into it
 
<h3> PWN </h3>
  - Managed to get a flag with a buffer overflow exploit

<h3> Crypto </h3>
  - Did a few of these<br>
  - I've done crypto challenges in the past so these were familar but still challenging
